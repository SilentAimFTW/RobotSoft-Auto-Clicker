This is my first official public development project, called RobotSoft Auto Clicker.

To set it up, first download the file, which you have obviously already done. Then, open up the RobotSoft Auto Clicker.exe file, and that should open the setup wizard for the auto clicker. Once you are done customizing your settings, you are ready to use your auto clicker!
